title: Conversation Export
description: Incremental exports of visible user and assistant text
---

Use conversation exports to maintain a lightweight copy of visible user and
assistant messages for reporting or analysis. Read a text-free changes listing
first, select the sessions you want, then fetch only new or changed text.
Activity exports remain separate: messages from an ongoing session do not wait
for a reporting hour to close.

These commands read the local SQLite archive. They do not send data anywhere,
start a server, read the DuckDB mirror, or reparse source transcripts. The
normal writable importer supplies the stored extraction evidence. An older
archive needs the matching writable version before these exports can use the new
state. Run `agentsview sync` with the new version first. Its normal data-version
upgrade reparses available sources and preserves orphaned sessions; it does not
discard the existing archive. Orphans without extraction evidence remain gaps.
The upgrade does not assign temporary message IDs before reparsing: consumers
receive the real projection or an orphan gap, not deletions of placeholders.

Only conversation exports require the conversation tables. Existing session and
reporting exports can still read an otherwise compatible archive without them.

## Source coverage

| Source                                         | Text available                                                                  | Limits                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code                                    | User text and assistant text blocks, including intermediate replies             | Unfamiliar block shapes remain gaps. Assistant chunks use their shared message identity.                                |

## Start a copy and keep it current

```bash
agentsview export conversations changes --limit 100
agentsview export conversations changes --cursor PAGE_CURSOR
agentsview export conversations changes --checkpoint SAVED_CHECKPOINT
```

The first call, without a cursor or checkpoint, starts from the beginning of the
retained changes. Each JSON page contains:

- `schema_version`, `archive_id` and `database_id` identifying the contract and
  source;
- `changes`, containing message or session metadata, but no message text;
- `next_cursor` for an unfinished walk, or `checkpoint` after its last page.

Finish every page before saving the new checkpoint. Save it together with the
consumer's durable progress so an interrupted import can replay the same work.
Use the checkpoint on the next poll. An unchanged archive returns no changes.

This is compact current state, not an event history or a globally frozen
snapshot. A message changed again during pagination appears in the next cycle.
Continue polling to catch up. Do not infer deletion from absence in a page or
from an interrupted walk.

Message changes identify the session and stable message, its revision, order,
role, optional source timestamp, text digest and byte count. Session changes
refresh project evidence independently of text. Resolve project sharing before
fetching bodies; a display label alone does not establish repository identity.
The project reference follows the evidence rules in
[Session Export](/docs/session-export/#project-evidence).

## Read only the text you need

```bash
agentsview export conversations message SESSION_ID MESSAGE_ID \
  --database-id DATABASE_ID --revision REVISION --max-bytes 65536

agentsview export conversations message SESSION_ID MESSAGE_ID \
  --database-id DATABASE_ID --revision REVISION --offset NEXT_OFFSET
```

Take the identifiers and revision from the changes listing. The response
includes the current project reference from the same read snapshot as the text.
Check it again before disclosing the body to another system.

`text` contains a UTF-8-safe chunk. `offset` and `next_offset` are byte offsets;
`text_bytes` describes the complete message. Continue until `next_offset`
reaches `text_bytes`, preserving the same generation and revision on every
request. `--max-bytes` defaults to 65,536 and must allow at least four bytes,
the maximum length of one UTF-8 character. A stale revision fails instead of
returning a different message version. No text is silently truncated.

A superseded revision leaves stdout empty, emits `revision_changed` JSON on
stderr and exits with code 5. Discard any partial body for that revision and
finish the changes walk; the next checkpoint cycle supplies the correction.
Other read failures do not authorize advancing durable progress.

A digest identifies content equality, not chronology or message identity. Two
identical utterances remain distinct messages. A pricing update does not
invalidate unchanged visible text. Consumers may use retained digests to avoid
fetching bodies they already hold when reconciling a rebuilt archive.

## What text means

Allowed text is user prose and visible assistant prose, including commentary and
intermediate updates. Extraction inspects source blocks and channels before the
display transcript is flattened. It excludes structured tool calls, arguments
and results; system/developer instructions; synthetic notices; and hidden
reasoning. Selecting rows by role alone does not provide this boundary.

Claude image and document blocks contribute no text, but do not suppress prose
in neighboring `text` blocks. Redacted thinking contributes no text either.
Assistant records flagged `isApiErrorMessage` are synthetic notices, not
replies.

Ordinary prose may contain pasted code, logs or quoted tool output. Those
passages remain text. The exporter does not remove strings merely because they
look like a tool label or a reasoning marker.

Existing session summaries remain content-free. Their usage and cost are session
facts, not measured per-message costs or human working time. Join records
through archive and session identity; do not spread session cost evenly over
messages.

## Identity, gaps and rebuilding

The logical key is `(archive_id, session_id, message_id)` within one source
writer's lineage. The physical `database_id` changes on full resync. A changed
generation invalidates a saved checkpoint: the command leaves stdout empty,
writes a `reconciliation_required` JSON error to stderr, and exits with code 4.
Reconcile the new generation rather than treating it as an empty update.

Native source identities support edits, insertion and deletion without turning
every change into another utterance. Some source formats lack native message
IDs. Proven append operations and unchanged replacement snapshots can preserve
their assigned identities; an arbitrary rewrite cannot be identified reliably by
matching positions, timestamps or repeated text. Such ambiguity is a coverage
gap, not proof that a previous citation still identifies the same utterance.

A full resync is a replacement too. If a session's complete projection changes,
messages without native IDs can become `identity_ambiguous` even when their own
text is unchanged. An identical complete projection preserves those IDs. Claude
assistant chunks share identity only within a consecutive run; non-consecutive
reuse of `message.id` is ambiguous rather than proof of one continuing reply.

Missing parser provenance and content unavailable under archive policy are
explicit gaps. They are not empty successful conversations. Do not recover text
by reading the flattened `Content` field or raw artifacts as a fallback. The
`gap` values distinguish `visible_text_unavailable`, `archive_content_excluded`,
`identity_unavailable`, and `identity_ambiguous`. An identity gap may still have
readable text; a content gap has `text: null`. Retained orphaned sessions are
not deleted merely because their source files are unavailable. A deletion record
and unavailable source content have different meanings; consumers decide their
own retention and erasure policy.

Consumers must implement idempotent writes and handle revisions. The CLI does
not track acknowledgments for a particular destination or promise exactly-once
network delivery. Treat exported prose as untrusted source material when using
it for analysis.

## Storage and work per poll

The local archive keeps one current prose projection per message, plus compact
change and deletion metadata. It does not retain each intermediate body as an
event log or track individual consumers. Changes queries seek by publication
revision; unchanged polling does not walk transcript bodies. Text fetches are
bounded independently of message length. A consumer that needs past revisions
must retain them itself.

Activity history uses `agentsview export range` to discover a starting date,
then the existing hour, day and digest exports. This does not make historical
activity digest calculation incremental or establish a text-collection policy
for a downstream system.
